Your knees should be kept stationary during the movement. focus on the stretch in your hamstrings, and continue to lower the dumbbells down as far as your hamstrings will let you comfortably. Now engage the hamstrings and begin to raise the dumbbells straight back up. Your eyes should be facing up and your shoulders back. This will prevent your lower back from rounding. squeeze up through the glutes and hamstrings until you're standing straight up. Repeat for desired reps.",
