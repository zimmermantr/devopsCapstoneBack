116	Dumbbell Bench Press	push	3	8,10,12	beginner	dumbbell, bench	Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width. Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position. Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.	chest	shoulders, triceps	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Dumbbell_Bench_Press/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Dumbbell_Bench_Press/images/1.jpg	\N	1
117	Lat Pulldown	pull	3	8,10,12	beginner	adjustable cable machine, lat pulldown bar	Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar. Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms. After a second at the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.	lats	biceps, middle back, shoulders	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Wide-Grip_Lat_Pulldown/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Wide-Grip_Lat_Pulldown/images/1.jpg	\N	1
118	Overhead Dumbbell Press	push	3	8,10,12	beginner	dumbbells	Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. Hold a pair of dumbbells just outside of your shoulders with your arms bent and palms facing each other. Press both dumbbells up until the weights are overhead and your arms are straight. Pause, then lower the dumbbells under control back to the starting position.	shoulders	abs, delts	https://www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/overhead-press-compressed-800.jpg?w=300&quality=86&strip=all	https://www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/overhead-press-extended-800.jpg?w=300&quality=86&strip=all	\N	1
119	Leg Press	push	3	8,10,12	beginner	machine	Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section). Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position. As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle. Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.	quadriceps	calves, glutes, hamstrings	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Leg_Press/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Leg_Press/images/1.jpg	\N	1
120	Lying Leg Curls	pull	3	8,10,12	beginner	machine	Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and lie face down on the leg curl machine with the pad of the lever on the back of your legs (just a few inches under the calves). Tip: Preferably use a leg curl machine that is angled as opposed to flat since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment. Keeping the torso flat on the bench, ensure your legs are fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances described on the foot positioning section). This will be your starting position. As you exhale, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting the upper legs from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second. As you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.	hamstrings		https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Lying_Leg_Curls/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Lying_Leg_Curls/images/1.jpg	\N	1
121	Rope Pressdown	push	3	8,10,12	beginner	adjustable cable machine, rope attachment	Attach a rope attachment to a high pulley and grab with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the rope with the palms facing each other. This is your starting position. Using the triceps, bring the rope down as you bring each side of the rope to the side of your thighs. At the end of the movement the arms are fully extended and perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement. After holding for a second, at the contracted position, bring the rope slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.	triceps		https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Triceps_Pushdown_-_Rope_Attachment/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Triceps_Pushdown_-_Rope_Attachment/images/1.jpg	\N	1
122	Barbell Biceps Curl	pull	3	8,10,12	beginner	barbell	Stand up with your torso upright while holding a barbell at a shoulder-width grip. The palm of your hands should be facing forward and the elbows should be close to the torso. This will be your starting position. While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard. Slowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.	biceps		https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Barbell_Curl/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Barbell_Curl/images/1.jpg	\N	1
123	Standing Calf Raise	push	3	15-20	beginner	machine	Adjust the padded lever of the calf raise machine to fit your height. Place your shoulders under the pads provided and position your toes facing forward (or using any of the two other positions described at the beginning of the chapter). The balls of your feet should be secured on top of the calf block with the heels extending off it. Push the lever up by extending your hips and knees until your torso is standing erect. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.	calves	forearms	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Standing_Calf_Raises/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Standing_Calf_Raises/images/1.jpg	\N	1
124	Crunch	pull	3	15	beginner	body only	Lie flat on your back with your feet flat on the ground, or resting on a bench with your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. If you are resting your feet on a bench, place them three to four inches apart and point your toes inward so they touch. Now place your hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your elbows in. Tip: Don't lock your fingers behind your head. While pushing the small of your back down in the floor to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin to roll your shoulders off the floor. Continue to push down as hard as you can with your lower back as you contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders should come up off the floor only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the floor. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, controlled movement - don't cheat yourself by using momentum. After the one second contraction, begin to come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.	abdominals		https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Crunches/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Crunches/images/1.jpg	\N	1
125	Barbell Bench Press	push	3	10,12,15	beginner	barbell	Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position. From the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest. After a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.	chest	shoulders, triceps	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Barbell_Bench_Press_-_Medium_Grip/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Barbell_Bench_Press_-_Medium_Grip/images/1.jpg	\N	1
126	Dumbbell Flyes	push	3	10,12,15	beginner	dumbbell	Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other. Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other. Raise the dumbbells up like you're pressing them, but stop and hold just before you lock out. This will be your starting position. With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint. Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights. Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.	chest		https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Dumbbell_Flyes/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Dumbbell_Flyes/images/1.jpg	\N	1
127	Barbell Bent-Over Row	pull	3	10,12,15	beginner	barbell	Holding a barbell with a pronated grip (palms facing down), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position. Now, while keeping the torso stationary, breathe out and lift the barbell to you. Keep the elbows close to the body and only use the forearms to hold the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause. Then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.	middle back	biceps, lats, shoulders	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Bent_Over_Barbell_Row/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Bent_Over_Barbell_Row/images/1.jpg	\N	1
95	1A. Flat Barbell Bench Press	push	3	10-12	beginner	barbell bench	Lie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width. Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench. Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back. Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest. Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.					\N	1

Position your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances described on the foot positioning section). This will be your starting position. As you exhale, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting the upper legs from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second. As you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.	hamstrings		https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Lying_Leg_Curls/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Lying_Leg_Curls/images/1.jpg	\N	1

Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position. Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you perform this step. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. Also, make sure that the force is performed with the back muscles and not the arms. Finally, the upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the dumbbell; therefore do not try to pull the dumbbell up using the forearms. Lower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat the movement for the specified amount of repetitions. Switch sides and repeat again with the other arm.	middle back	biceps, lats, shoulders	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/One-Arm_Dumbbell_Row/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/One-Arm_Dumbbell_Row/images/1.jpg	\N	1

179	Lat Pulldown	pull	5	8,8,10,10,12	beginner	adjustable cable machine, lat pulldown bar	Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar. Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms. After a second at the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.	lats	biceps, middle back, shoulders	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Wide-Grip_Lat_Pulldown/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/master/exercises/Wide-Grip_Lat_Pulldown/images/1.jpg	\N	1

Your body will follow your head so keep your head up and eyes forward! Be sure to keep a straight back and never allow it to round. You are now in the starting position. focus on standing up with the dumbbells - not pulling them from the floor, and lead with your head as you rise. Drive with your heals and explode upward (leading with your head) as you rise. As the dumbbells rise to knee level, thrust your hips forward and contract your back by bringing your shoulder blades back. pause here for a moment and then reverse the movement by bending at the knees while slowly lowering the weight - keeping the dumbbells under strict control on the descent. Reset your stance if necessary and repeat for desired reps.	lower back	calves, forearms, glutes, hamstrings, middle back, quads, traps	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/cffbbc501abe63b87e7319bd61528f8146151ab4/exercises/Stiff-Legged_Dumbbell_Deadlift/images/0.jpg	https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/blob/cffbbc501abe63b87e7319bd61528f8146151ab4/exercises/Stiff-Legged_Dumbbell_Deadlift/images/1.jpg	\N	1

84	Skullcrusher	push	3	8-12	beginner	ez-bar, barbells	Lay on the bench so that the weights are lined up with your head. Flex your elbows and lower the weight toward the top of your head. Your upper arms should remain relatively perpendicular to your body. This keeps the tension on the triceps versus shifting it to the shoulders. Continue lowering the weight behind the head. The bottom of the dumbbell head should be about in line with the bench's top, or even a little higher if this feels unwieldy. Reverse the movement until the weight is above the chest in the original starting position. Keep from locking the elbow to maintain tension in your triceps muscle.Reverse the movement until the weight is above the chest in the original starting position. Keep from locking the elbow to maintain tension in your triceps muscle.	triceps				\N	1
85	Dumbbell Curl	pull	3	8-12	beginner	dumbell	Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand at arm's length. Keep your elbows close to your torso and rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward. This will be your starting position. Now, keeping the upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps. Then, inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.					\N	1
86	Leg Press	push	4	8-12	beginner	leg press machine	Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position. As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle. Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale.	quadriceps	calves, glutes, hamstrings			\N	1
87	Walking Lunge	push	3	10-15 each	beginner	dumbells	Begin standing with your feet shoulder width apart and a barbell across your upper back. Step forward with one leg, flexing the knees to drop your hips. Descend until your rear knee nearly touches the ground. Your posture should remain upright, and your front knee should stay above the front foot. Drive through the heel of your lead foot and extend both knees to raise yourself back up. Step forward with your rear foot, repeating the lunge on the opposite leg.	quadriceps	calves, glutes, hamstrings			\N	1
88	Standing Calf Raise	push	2	15-20	beginner	standing calf-raise machine	Adjust the padded lever of the calf raise machine to fit your height. Place your shoulders under the pads provided and position your toes facing forward (or using any of the two other positions described at the beginning of the chapter). The balls of your feet should be secured on top of the calf block with the heels extending off it. Push the lever up by extending your hips and knees until your torso is standing erect. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.	calves				\N	1
89	Seated Cable Row		3	10-15	beginner	seated cabel machine	Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles. With your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise. Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in.	middle back	biceps, lats, shoulders			\N	1
90	Barbell Row	pull	4	8-12	beginner	barbell	Holding a barbell with a pronated grip (palms facing down), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position. Now, while keeping the torso stationary, breathe out and lift the barbell to you. Keep the elbows close to the body and only use the forearms to hold the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause. Then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.	middle back	biceps, lats, shoulders			\N	1

4	Weeks 1-4	During the first month of strength training, workouts should include 1 to 3 sets of each of the 10 to 12 different exercises with a one-minute rest between exercises. Perform the exercises using a moderate weight. Beginners with a very low level of fitness may need to get in shape before participating in a strength training program that maximizes gains in muscular fitness. In other words, if you have never strength trained before, additional time for muscular adaptation is recommended. For example, instead of performing 8 to 12 exercises with a moderate weight, try performing 4 to 6 different exercises with a light weight, and perhaps perform only 1 set per exercise. This will give you an opportunity to gain confidence in your ability to strength train. A major goal of this training phase is to learn proper form and technique on a variety of upper- and lower-body exercises while practicing training fundamentals (e.g., proper technique, controlled movements, maintaining a normal breathing pattern). Thus, an initial load of 60 to 65 percent of 1RM will allow you to be in the zone of 10 to 12 repetitions on a variety of upper- and lower-body exercises that target all the major muscle groups. Of course, you can use lighter loads when learning a new exercise or attempting to correct a flaw in exercise technique. At least one exercise for all the major muscle groups should be performed.	1
5	Weeks 5-8	During weeks 5 through 8, the workout should become more challenging as strength and coordination improve. By varying the program variables, you start to accomplish specific goals in health and fitness, and you prevent the boredom and training plateaus that eventually lead to a lack of adherence to the program or to dropping out of the program entirely. This is a good time to think about the physical and psychosocial benefits of strength training. Although positive changes in physical abilities certainly are important, so too are the qualitative changes associated with a more active lifestyle. During this period, increase the training volume by performing 3 to 4 sets of 10 exercises at a training intensity of about 75 percent of 1RM (8-10 repetitions). Rest for about one to two minutes between sets. As additional sets are performed in the training program, continued effort will determine training outcomes. Thus, you should expect and welcome the feelings of exercise exertion. A major goal of this conditioning phase is to be confident in your exercises while maximizing training adaptations.	1
6	Weeks 9-12	After the first eight weeks of strength training, improvements in muscular fitness will occur at a slower rate. Beginners who started strength training with great enthusiasm may become disappointed when gains in muscle strength become less dramatic during the third month of training. This is where you need to understand that a strength training workout that was effective during the first few weeks of training may not be effective in the long term. To make continual gains in muscular fitness and to achieve specific health and fitness goals, higher intensities and a more challenging training program are required (i.e., the principle of progressive overload). This is particularly important for people who want to maximize gains in muscle strength or muscle size. During this phase, perform 3 to 4 sets of 8 exercises at a training intensity of 75 to 80 percent of 1RM (6-8 repetitions). Rest about two to three minutes between sets. Although endless combinations of program variables can be used, continued improvement requires that you increase the training weight and reduce the repetitions to the lower end of the training zone once you have performed the desired number of repetitions on the last set. As a general recommendation, you should perform more sets on exercises for large muscle groups than on exercises for smaller muscle groups. However, research has shown that beginners do not experience greater strength gains when performing more than 4 sets per exercise. Therefore, any exercise should probably not be performed for longer than 4 sets.	1
7	Upper Body A	Reps are done based off an RPE (rate of percieved exertion) scale. For example, if the reps call for 7 RPE, you should stop when you can still do 2-3 reps after, while reps calling for 9 RPE should be nearing muscle failure.	1
8	Lower Body A	Reps are done based off an RPE (rate of percieved exertion) scale. For example, if the reps call for 7 RPE, you should stop when you can still do 2-3 reps after, while reps calling for 9 RPE should be nearing muscle failure.	1
9	Upper Body B	Reps are done based off an RPE (rate of percieved exertion) scale. For example, if the reps call for 7 RPE, you should stop when you can still do 2-3 reps after, while reps calling for 9 RPE should be nearing muscle failure.	1
